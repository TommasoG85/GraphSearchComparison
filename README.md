# Graph Search Comparison

Graph Search Comparison is a Python script that compares the performance of two different search algorithms, Solomonoff Induction and No Free Lunch, on a complete graph. It visualizes the paths found by each algorithm and provides insights into their efficiency and effectiveness.

## Introduction

In graph theory, search algorithms are essential for finding paths between nodes in a graph. Solomonoff Induction and No Free Lunch are two distinct approaches to graph search, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. This project aims to compare these algorithms in terms of their search strategies, pathfinding capabilities, and computational efficiency.

## Features

- **Graph Generation**: Automatically generates a complete graph with a specified number of nodes.
  
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Compares the paths found by Solomonoff Induction and No Free Lunch algorithms on the generated graph.
  
- **Visualization**: Visualizes the paths found by each algorithm on the graph, highlighting the differences in their search strategies.
  
- **Performance Analysis**: Calculates and compares the total search time and average search time for each algorithm.

## Usage

1. **Installation**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the required dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`.

2. **Running the Script**: Execute the `graph_search_comparison.py` script to compare the search algorithms on a complete graph.

3. **Interpreting Results**: Analyze the visualized paths and performance metrics provided to understand the differences between Solomonoff Induction and No Free Lunch algorithms.

## Examples

```bash
python graph_search_comparison.py
```
